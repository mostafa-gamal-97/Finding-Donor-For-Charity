## Project Description

Help a fictitious charity organization to build a classification algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost and time for sending mails,
My task was to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
